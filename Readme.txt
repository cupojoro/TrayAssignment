	and input element that passes a text file to the function "processFile". Recommended event
	handler is 'onchange'.

Dependencies and Testing:
	There are no dependencies for this file outside of an updated browser.
	All testing was done on Chrome.

Usage:
	1. Once the html file has been created please include both the Roomba.js file and all the support text
files into the same directory; or as required by your source path.
	2. Open up the HTML file in your favorite browser and follow the onscreen prompt to choose a file. The "InputText.txt" file
will run successfully where as all other .txt files included will test a failure point.
	3. Open the inspector (on Chrome, right click the webpage and select it from the toolbar) and navigate to the console tab.
	4. All outputs will be logged in the console.
	
Cheers!
